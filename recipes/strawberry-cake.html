        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This strawberry cake is easy to make from scratch with strawberry puree and strawberry 
        gelatin. This recipe is worth its weight in gold to me as a caterer. I made this cake for 
        a child's birthday party and it was a major hit! Frost with cream cheese frosting or 
        chocolate ganache for a special treat.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-O®</li>
            <li>4 large eggs (room temperature)</li>
            <li>2 ¾ cups sifted cake flour</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
            <li>½ cup strawberry puree made from frozen sweetened strawberries</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps for make this cake</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch 
            round cake pans.</li>
            
            <li>Beat sugar, butter, and dry strawberry gelatin together in a large bowl with an 
            electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each 
            addition.</li>
            
            <li>Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl; stir into butter mixture 
            alternately with milk. Blend in strawberry puree and vanilla. Divide batter evenly 
            between the prepared pans.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out 
            clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes; run a table 
            knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack 
            to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
